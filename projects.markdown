I am (and was) involved in several projects:

### CIME (Interreg / 2018-2022)

This is a collaborative France-Switzerland project that focuses on methods and tools assisting mountain experts in their decision making process in the context of snowfall risk. The project aims at developing augmented reality mobile application prototypes.

### Tourism Itinerary (USMB-UPPA / 2018-2019)

This is a collaborative Univ. Savoie Mont-Blanc and Univ. Pau and Pays de l'Adour project (LISTIC and LIUPPA labs) that focuses on information system and decision aiding software system design. Such software systems promote tourism activities and cultural assets: touristic activities information, cultural assets information, end-user profiles and preferences are modelled and processed by a recommender system we design.

### Transfrontour (Interreg / 2016-2019)

This is a collaborative France-Switzerland project that focuses on collaborative networks in tourism sector. This project aims at improving colloration experience amongst tourism stakeholders. Our specific role is about an information fusion software system. Such system is a kind of recommendation software application that combines tourism information.

### AAP MVT (USMB / 2015-2016)

This project targets mobile application for mountain outdoor itinerary, assisting moutain practitioner in decision-making. The project deals with two facets: (1) fuzzy rule-based approach for information aggregation, (2) an augmented reality mobile application (a graphical rendering) combining a Digital Elevation Model, informations relevant to mountain itinerary, the mobile device camera visualization.

### Action PING (GDR GPL / 2013-2014)

This specific PING workgroup deals with software engineering curricula and practices; it aims at drawing a common curricula framework and possibly a dedicated plateform and specific set of tools/toolkits.

### OpenCloudware (2012-2014)

The OpenCloudware project aims at building an open software engineering platform, for the collaborative development of distributed applications to be deployed on multiple Cloud infrastructures. The results of OpenCloudware will contain a set of software components to manage the lifecycle of such applications, from modelling (Think), developing and building images (Build), to a multi-IaaS compliant PaaS platform (Run) for their deployment, orchestration, performance testing, self-management (elasticity, green IT optimisation) and provisioning. Applications will be deployed potentially on multi IaaS (supporting either one IaaS at a time, or hybrid scenarios).The results of the project will be made available as open source components through the OW2 Open Source Cloudware initiative. OpenCloudware is a collaborative project. The project members include industry and academic leaders, innovative technology start-ups and a world-renowned open source community. OpenCloudware outputs will be offered under an OSI compliant open source license and the code distributed via the OW2 Consortium software forge as part of the OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative.

### Performance SOA (2011-2012)

This project adresses SOA performance and quality. Methodological approaches (performance indicators, SOA metrics, QoS, information fusion methods,...) are investigated and part of the work will be fondaments for a services orchestration supervision system. This project also deals with applying a Service-based approach to (1) manufacturing enterprise architectures and to (2) image processing software systems.

### ISPRIT PLM (2009-2011)

It is a GOSPI cluster funded project that is focusing on Product Lifecycle Management systems from multidisciplinary points of view (i.e. software engineering, mecanical engineering, production/manufacturing engineering, information system).

### MES/MESTRIA (2008-2011)

It is a Cluster Edit and Rhone-Alpes region funded project (FEDER funds). I am the LISTIC Lab. scientific responsible for that project. The project consortium comprises 7 small and medium software companies (manufacturing and/or industrial software solution providers), 2 labs (LISTIC and LIESP) and Thesame. The project aims to provide an adaptable and agile MES solution; such MES solution is built by reusing these existing software applications (those of software solution providers) by adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture. A new MES software solution (MESTRIA) is under development, partially based on our R&D results (a SOA software solution).

### SIMSYPROD (2008-2009)

It is a GOSPI cluster funded action that aims at focusing on mechatronic product co-design under an inter-disciplinary vision. Such vision emphasizes mechatronic specific domain, software-based systems architectures, product life management, enterprise and information systems modelling. I am personnaly involved in software-based systems architectures and information systems modelling that support mechatronic activities, and especially in a dynamic perspective (agile systems). SOA are candidates for such architectures.

### Web Intelligence (2004-2008 and 2008-2011)

Région Rhône-Alpes three years funded project, cluster _Informatique, Signal, Logiciel Embarqué (Computer Science, Signal, Embedded systems)_.

Our participation within the Workpackage 2 focuses on adaptative Web. We are particularly interested on Web Services composition. Multi-Agent Systems and Software Engineering are basis of our approach: "Multi-Agent infrastructure for the web services composition and adaptation, taking into account quality of service".

### Opendil (2006-2007)

This project's goal is about extending our software architecture approach and environment to a professional software engineering Integrated Development Environment. The purpose of the project is also to consider a startup company being able to support this IDE.

### Cook (2006-2009)

Cook is a ANR 2006 three years project funded by [GIP-ANR](http://www.gip-anr.fr/) (JC05 42872).

The project is focusing on architecture refactoring. A one week and enthousiastic Moose environment tutorial has been organized and animated by [Tudor Girba](http://www.iam.unibe.ch/%7Egirba/). This project partially supports [Nimrod](./software.php) environment.

### ArchWare (2001-2005)

ArchWare (ARCHitecting evolvable softWARE) European IST-2001-32360 funded project

ArchWare designed, developed, and disseminated innovative architecture-centric languages, frameworks and tools for engineering evolvable software systems. It defined formal architectural style-based languages for describing and analysing design-time and run-time evolvable software architectures taking into account reuse of components. Customised process-driven environments provided tools to support architectural models (including quality attributes), reasoning about these models, and refining them into compliant implementations. The project built on and advanced baseline complementary researches in the areas of software architectures and reflective frameworks from three EU member states. The adequacy and industrial relevance of the project results were validated in real-life business cases from different industrial domains.

### WebWare (2003-2004)

Langages et outils pour les architectures orientées services Web : l'ubiquité dans l'Internet de 3ème génération au service de l'intégration des applications d'entreprises en réseau.

Région Rhône-Alpes Emergence program French funded project. WebWare aimed at providing a Services Oriented Architectures development framework. This project focused on SOA descriptions according to a formal-based approach. The experimentation addressed a _Manufacturing Execution System_ scenario involving several interacting Web Services.

### MES (2004)

MES (Manufacturing Executing System)

R&D project in partnership with IUP GSI and Club ERA (associating some editors of ERP and software solutions for industrial customers). This project addressed a technical solution for integrating existing industrial software solutions, ERP, legacy systems,..., by the way of Web Services.

### PIE (1998-2001)

PIE (Process Instance Evolution), European Esprit-IV Open LTR project n° 34840

The objective of PIE was to define a framework allowing managers to pilot and implement on-line dynamic evolution and changes to distributed work activity supported by distributed instances of process models. The PIE consortium developed a methodology for process dynamic evolution based on the following approaches:

*   process modeling language,
*   process-centered environment,
*   pro-active process monitoring using fuzzy-set theory,
*   distributed and mobile component-based architecture,
*   event-based communication,
*   distributed transaction.

PIE objectives, approach and results are explained in scientific publications.
