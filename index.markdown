I am Associate Professor in Computer Science at the Université Savoie Mont-Blanc (previously named University of Savoie) since 09/2002\. I received a BSc. and MSc. (1996) in _**Mathematics and Computer Science**_ from the University of Savoie and a MSc. (1997) in _**Information Systems**_ from the University of Grenoble. I received my Ph.D. (2001) in _**Computer Science**_ from the University of Savoie (now Universite Savoie Mont-Blanc), under the supervision of the CNRS (french research organization) Research Director and Adele Team leader, Jacky Estublier and the Professor Flavio Oquendo (I also want to thank the Professor Pierre-Yves Cunin, University of Grenoble, for his support during my PhD). I was member of both LSR Lab. (CNRS UMR 5526) from 1997 to 2001 and LLP Lab. from 1998 to 2002\. More information on my Ph.D. can be found [here](http://tel.ccsd.cnrs.fr/tel-00010877). I was teaching and research assistant from 09/2000 to 09/2002 at the University of Savoie - UFR Sciences Fondamentales et Appliquées (Now UFR Sciences et Montagne) - LLP Lab. (Software for Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory).

I was employed and worked for several companies (IT, communication, NGO) from 1993 to 1999; I also managed my own IT company (1996-1999). I left when I joined the academic world as PhD student (with a french Research Government Department scholarship/grant - _bourse MENESR_).
