My lectures mainly concern the following curricula:

*   University Institute of Technology - R&T Dept. (two-year undergraduate diploma)
*   IAE Bachelor of Economics and Management (Information System curricula - BS. Degree)
*   IAE Master of Management and Information System (MSI MSc. Degree)

...and in the following fields of expertise:

*   **information system**
*   **software engineering**
*   **business process management**
*   **service science**

The courses I teach (as instructor leader or co-instructor) are the following:

*   [Object oriented programming in Java](./programmationJava.php) (IUT R&T, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   [Introduction to algorithms and programming - aka. Informatique 1](./informatique1.php) (IAE IS Bachelor degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   [Object oriented design and programming - aka. Informatique 2](./informatique2.php) (IAE IS Bachelor degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   Information system design and engineering (IAE MIS MSc. degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   Mobile application technologies (IAE MIS MSc. degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   Distributed or service-based information system architectures (IAE MIS MSc. degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   Information system security (IAE MIS MSc. degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)
*   Research approach and methodology (IAE MIS MSc. degree, Univ. Savoie Mont Blanc)

Some teaching materials are available online with reserved grants access. If you have suggestions, I really appreciate your feedbacks, comments...Don't hesitate !

Office hours: mainly Tuesday and Friday 12am-2pm (send me an email to schedule an **appointment**).

Think about thinking, learn about learning

Except for several lectures for which I give all of the resources (slides, documentation, exercice responses,...), I am no more enthousiastic to provide all slides, etc. Well, it's not a way of life no more a religious decision but...As I observe, students do not know/want (more) take notes, do not know think about slides contents and have no real motivation to search documentation by their own. It's quite a pity but that's it.

Recommandations for students: please, read books, read white-papers, search documentation in library, bookstore (even using google but be carefull !), ask me for references and bibliography, and...<span style="font-weight: bold;">be curious</span>, don't wait for us, don't wait for a mysterious help. Learning is one of better thing in the life :-)  
I am responsible of several lectures but as you may observe, some other colleagues and IT specialists, experts are involved with me. Also my previous professional (in IT companies) experience is quite interesting in order to build a course, especially in professional MS degree.

I make frequently changes in my lectures according to audience and other considerations like students feedbacks, colleagues feedbacks, personal research and readings and computer science, IT evolution and progress. It is up to you remaining in touch with the last release of courses resources.

# Somes notes...

An Information System (IS) is a software sensitive system but not necessary a software system ! Very often, a software-based system supports partially an information system (because information system - information - is not entirely automated - i.e. humains cannot be automated): as consequence, a computer-based (software-based) system is part of an information system;

OOD vs. OOP: as OO Design focuses on how to design problems using objects (all is object), independently of computer, OO Programming deals with other considerations specific to computers (i.e. OO program stuctures, specific OOP data structures, memory management - if relevant -,  files system, I/O, devices, control structures,...);

like some other disciplines, programming cannot be (just) a theorical discipline; I always recommend to practice, do exercices, do again same exercices in order to be more fluent in programming. Programming is not especially difficult, no more it is reserved to alien guys. The deal is: how long you are willing to spend ?

programming is like art ? Well there are many papers on this subject. Software engineering is a scientific discipline that tries to bring methods, approaches, means in order to manage, control, organize...improve software production.
