    Think about thinking, learn about learning
  </p>

  <p>
    Except for several lectures for which I give all of the resources (slides,
documentation, exercice responses,...), I am no more enthousiastic to
provide all slides, etc. Well, it's not a way of life no more a
religious decision but...As I observe, students do not know/want (more) take notes,
do not know think about slides contents and have no real motivation to
search documentation by their own. It's quite a pity but that's it. </p>

Recommandations for students: please, read books, read white-papers, search documentation in library, bookstore
(even using google but be carefull !), ask me for references and
bibliography, and...<span style="font-weight: bold;">be curious</span>, don't wait for us, don't wait for a mysterious help. Learning is one of better thing in the life :-)
  <br />I am responsible of several lectures but as you may observe, some other colleagues and IT specialists, experts are involved with me. Also my previous
professional (in IT companies) experience is quite interesting in order to build a
course, especially in professional MS degree.
  <p>
    I make frequently changes in my lectures according to audience and
other considerations like students feedbacks, colleagues feedbacks, personal research and readings and
computer science, IT evolution and progress. It is up to you remaining in touch with the last release of courses resources.</p>

        An Information System (IS) is a software sensitive system but not
necessary a software system ! Very often, a software-based system
supports partially an information system (because
information system - information - is not entirely automated - i.e.
humains cannot
be automated): as consequence, a computer-based (software-based) system
is part of an information system;</p>
      <p>OOD vs. OOP: as OO Design focuses on how to design problems using objects
(all is object), independently of computer, OO Programming deals with
other considerations specific to computers (i.e. OO program stuctures,
specific OOP data structures, memory management - if relevant -,&nbsp;
files system, I/O, devices, control structures,...);</p>
<p>like
some other disciplines, programming cannot be (just) a theorical
discipline; I always recommend to practice, do exercices, do again same
exercices in order to be more fluent in programming. Programming is not
especially difficult, no more it is reserved to alien guys. The deal
is: how long you are willing to spend ?</p>
<p>programming
is like art ? Well there are many papers on this subject. Software
engineering is a scientific discipline that tries to bring methods,
approaches, means in order to manage, control, organize...improve
software production.</p>
