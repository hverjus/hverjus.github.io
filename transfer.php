I was in charge of the LISTIC's transfers with industry and enterprises. I am personnaly involved in some patnerships with SMEs. One of the transfer opportunity concerned a software architecture-centric approach, environment and toolkit. Such project is called <b>Opendil</b> related to the ArchWare technology and approach.
<br>
I lead R&D activities and research collaborations with software and services enterprises. I was scientific advisor and expert for the Opendil project.
<br>
I also lead some research projects with software editor companies and/or manufacturing companies (see <a href="./projects.php"> the project section</a>).
